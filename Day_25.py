#DAY_25 : Operations on Tuples in Python

""" 
Manipulating Tuples
Tuples are immutable, hence if you want to add, remove or change tuple items, then first you must convert the tuple to a list. Then perform operation on that list and convert it back to tuple.
 """

countries = ("Spain", "Italy", "India", "England", "Germany")
temp = list(countries)
temp.append("Russia")       #add item 
temp.pop(3)                 #remove item
temp[2] = "Finland"         #change item
countries = tuple(temp)
print(countries) 

countries = ("Pakistan", "Afghanistan", "Bangladesh", "ShriLanka")
countries2 = ("Vietnam", "India", "China")
southEastAsia = countries + countries2
print(southEastAsia) 

""" 
Tuple methods
As tuple is immutable type of collection of elements it have limited built in methods.They are explained below
 """

""" 
count() Method
The count() method of Tuple returns the number of times the given element appears in the tuple.
