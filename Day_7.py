# DAY 7 : Operators And Exercise 1: Calculator using Python

""" 
Operators:
    1. Arithmetic Operators
        - Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations like addition, subtraction , multiplication and division etc.
        - +, -, *, /, %, **, //
    2. Assignment Operators
        - Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
        - =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=
    3. Comparison Operators
        - Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
        - ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
    4. Logical Operators
        - Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.
        - and, or, not
    5. Identity Operators
        - Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location.
        - is, is not
    6. Membership Operators
        - Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.
        - in, not in
    7. Bitwise Operators
        - Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers.
        - &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
