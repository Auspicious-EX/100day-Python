#DAY-1 : What is Programming and Python?

""" 
What is proframming ?
    - Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
    - These instructions might be to calculate a number, to display a message on the screen, or to carry out any of a million other tasks.
    - Whatever the task, the computer executes the instructions one at a time, in order, until the task is complete.
    - A set of instructions that tells a computer what to do is called a program, also known as software.
    
What is Python ?
    - Python is a programming language.
    - Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.
    - Python is designed to be highly readable.
    - It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
    - Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain.
    - Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language.
    - It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.
    
    Python Features
        - Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
        - Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
        - Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
        - A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
        - Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
        - Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.
        - Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.
        - Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
        - GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries, and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
        - Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.
        - Object Oriented − Python supports both procedural and OO programming styles.
        - It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.

What is Python used for?
    - Python is a general-purpose programming language, so it can be used for many things.
    - Python is used for web development, AI, machine learning, operating systems, mobile application development, and video games.
    - Pythom is used for data visualization to ctreate plots and graphical representations.
    - Python helps in Data analytics to analyze understand raw data for insights and trends.
    - It is used in AI and Machine learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
    - Python is used to create web applications.
    - It can be used to handle data bases.
    - It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical opartions along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.
